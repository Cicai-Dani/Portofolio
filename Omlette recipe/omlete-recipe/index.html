            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until
                    they
                    are
                    well mixed. You can
                    add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or
                    oil.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs.
                    Tilt
                    the pan
                    to ensure the eggs
                    evenly coat the surface. </li>
                <li><strong> Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still
                    slightly
                    runny in the
                    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette. </li>
                <li><strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and
                    fold
                    it over
                    the fillings.
                    Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate. </li>
                <li> <strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
